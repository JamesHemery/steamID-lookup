Demo Here: http://sly-gaming.com/steamid/

To include the steam player search tool in a page,
Unzip the steamidProcess.php, the steamidForm.php and the steamid.js file to the same directory as the page you want the tool on.
Add this to you PHP page that you want to include the Tool on. (must be PHP for now) :

<?php require("steamidForm.php"); ?>

thats it.
Now browse to the page and see if it worked.
Type in either the players steam id, community id, or community url.

There is a line in the steamidForm.php file that should not be remved at all.
Steam required that you include a link to steampowered.com on the pages that use any steam web api or community stats.
DO NOT!!! remove the line that says:

<a href="http://steampowered.com" target="_blank">Powered By Steam</a></p>.
